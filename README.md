<h1 align="center">üéì Free Code Camp Certificate</h1>

### üìù DESCRIPTION

<p align="justify">This repository shares the 5 challenges from Free Code Camp
 required to earn the Python Certificate.

### üìú DETAILED CHALLENGES

- [Challenge_1](/main_1.py): Create a function that receives a list of strings that are arithmetic problems and returns the problems arranged vertically and side-by-side.

- [Challenge_2](/main_2.py): Write a function that takes a start time and a duration. The function should add the duration to the start time and return the result.

- [Challenge_3](/main_3.py): Create a budget system that includes methods for depositing and withdrawing funds, with checks in place to ensure sufficient funds are available. This system should also support the transfer of funds between different budget categories.

- [Challenge_4](/main_4.py): Create a Rectangle class and a Square class. The Square class should be a subclass of Rectangle and inherit methods and attributes.

- [Challenge_5](/main_5.py): Create a program that receives a number of colored balls inside a hat and picks them randomly. After that, pick some random balls and use a function to find the probability. Instead of using complex mathematical calculations, the program will run a large number of experiments to estimate this probability.
